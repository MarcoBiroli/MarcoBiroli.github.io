                        This is a course taught by Pr. Adel Bilal in the Master ICFP program that I am currently following. We introduced relativistic
                        quantum mechanics by taking a semi-historical approach. We started from the postulates of both theories to develop the Klein-
                        Gordon Equation. After noticing the failures of the Klein-Gordon equation we used Lie groups/algebras symmetry arguments to derive
                        the Dirac equation. We are currently introducing Quantum Field Theory.

                        This is a course taught by Pr. Nick Kaiser in the Master ICFP program that I am currently following.  We started
                        by reviewing special relativity and developping the concepts of differential geometry in curved space-time and 
                        derived the Einstein field equations. We then developped the weak-field theory of gravity and applied it to 
                        gravitational waves and discussed other applications including black-holes and elementary stellar 
                        structure theory ; gravitational lensing ; the solar system (precession of Mercury’s orbit) ; 
                        and the derivation of the singularity theorems from Raychaudhuri’s equation. The second half of the course is 
                        deidcated to cosmology and is still ongoing.

                        This is a course taught by Pr. Stephane Fauve in the Master ICFP program that I am currently following. The first
                         part of the semester concerned deterministic dynamical systems. Specifically the study of non-linear systems,
                         their equilibriums/bifurcations. We also saw the universality of the behaviors close to bifurcations and 
                         how a series of bifurcations can lead to chaos.

                        mathematical formalism and tools to study symmetries in physics. We started from the bases of group theory, then moved
                        to the fundamentals of topology in order to introduce Lie groups and Lie algebras properly.

                        This is a course taught by Pr. Nathan Goldman in the Master ICFP program that I followed. We introduced some general
                        concets of differential geometry, mainly: manifolds, fiber bundles, Chern numbers, Berry connection/curvature/phase. We
                        then studied their physical application and meaning in different contexts ranging from superfluid vortices to the Haldane
                        model. Finally we introduced the mathematics that justify the study of artificial matter using Flouquet engineering.

                        introducing the micro-canonical, canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. The course finished on the thermodynamics
                        of fermions, low temperature free fermions, semi conductors, relativistic fermions and Bose Einstein statistics.

                        ( the residue theorem for example ), probability, analysis and many others.

                        Pr. Jean-Francois Allemand. It focused on variational principles and the Hamiltonian formulation required to
                        understand the quantum mechanics course. It then ended on some perturbation methods such as multiple scales approximations or
                        the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation.

                        after a quick treatment of perfect fluids moved to capillarity, waves, bi-dimensional flows, viscosity, boundary layers,
                        vorticity, instabilities and finally finished on turbulent flows.

                        This was a Bachelor 3 course at ENS taught by Pr. Frederic Chevy. It introduced the concepts of special relativity by studying
                        the Lorentz group and then applied the concepts to electromagnetism in order to derive the covariant formulation of electromagnetism.
                        We then saw multiple useful tools and base cases such as multipolar expansion and light scattering. Finally we finished on an introduction
                        to relativistic quantum mechanics. This course was evaluated on a 4 week research project during which I studied together with Alessandro Pacco
                        the propagation of light in chiral dielectric media.

                        physics which started with the electron gas model. We then saw the mathematical formalism of Bravais lattices and
                        Bloch's theorem, Fermi levels and energy bands. The course then finished by studying semi-conductors and super-conductivity.

                        We then moved on to random walks, the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and finished with percolation.

                        of complex analyis: definitions of holomorphic functions, Cauchy's Theorem, Goursat's Lemma. We then saw the main 
                        theorems of complex analysis: Liouville's theorem, zeros of analytic functions, Shwartz's Lemma, integral of holomorphic
                        functions, Weierstrass products and so on. We then studied meromorphic functions and residues. The second half of the course 
                        focused on more in-depth topics such as: indices, conformal representations, coverings, modular functions, harmonic functions and
                        elliptic modular functions.
