                        This is a course taught by Amir Kashani Poor in the M2 of the ICFP master. We started by rederiving what was done in the Relativistic 
                        Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory course taught by Adel Bilal in the M1. We built step by step the theory of QED and finally
                        the last part of the course focues on renormalization theory.

                        This is a course taught by Giulio Biroli in the M2 of the ICFP master. We started by studying stochastic dynamics and stochastic processes
                        leading to the MSRDJ path integral formulation as well as the Onsager-Machlup path integral and the Feynmann-Kac theory. We then studied time
                        reversal symmetry and fluctuation-dissipation relations. With which we then studied our first application, polymer models and collective phenomena.
                        We then looked at Mean Field Theory and in particular the Bethe approximation as well as a quick introduction to real space RG, which we used to study
                        topological defects such as the creation of vortices in the XY-model.

                        This is a course taught by Daniele Steer in the M2 of the ICFP master. The first half of the course was used to build the theory of General Relativity 
                        and re-derive Einstein's equations. Once we arrived at Einstein's equations we started studying all the different possible spherically symmetric solutions, 
                        in particular all the different types of black holes. We then moved on to gravitational waves and showed how they emerged as solutions of the Einstein equations.
                        Finally the course will finish on introducing some theories of modified gravity.

                        This is a course taught by Adam Nahum in the M2 of the ICFP master. The course was devoted to the Renormalization Group and its applications. We started by introducing
                        real space RG as well as studying its drawbacks. We then looked at statistical field theory, the mean field approximation, the 4-epsilon and 2+epsilon 
                        expansions to study the O(n) models at low dimensions.

                        This is a course that was split in two, the first half was taught by Alberto Rosso the second was taught by Rémi Monasson. In the first half we studied modern algorithms 
                        which are ubiquitous in physics today. We covered many algorithms used in many-body problems and complex systems, with special emphasis on Monte Carlo methods, molecular 
                        dynamics, and optimization in complex landscapes. The second half was focused on Bayesian statistics. We looked at statistical inference and machine learning tools to harness 
                        the growing availability of experimental data to design accurate models of the underlying, complex, strongly non-homogeneous and interacting systems.

                          This is a course taught by Pr. Adel Bilal in the ENS Master ICFP program that I am currently following. We introduced relativistic
                          quantum mechanics by taking a semi-historical approach. We started from the postulates of both theories to develop the Klein-
                          Gordon Equation. After noticing the failures of the Klein-Gordon equation we used Lie groups/algebras symmetry arguments to derive
                          the Dirac equation. We are currently introducing Quantum Field Theory.

                          by reviewing special relativity and developping the concepts of differential geometry in curved space-time and 
                          derived the Einstein field equations. We then developped the weak-field theory of gravity and applied it to 
                          gravitational waves and discussed other applications including black-holes and elementary stellar 
                          structure theory ; gravitational lensing ; the solar system (precession of Mercury’s orbit) ; 
                          and the derivation of the singularity theorems from Raychaudhuri’s equation. The second half of the course is 
                          deidcated to cosmology and is still ongoing.

                          part of the semester concerned deterministic dynamical systems. Specifically the study of non-linear systems,
                          their equilibriums/bifurcations. We also saw the universality of the behaviors close to bifurcations and 
                          how a series of bifurcations can lead to chaos.

                          to the fundamentals of topology in order to introduce Lie groups and Lie algebras properly.

                          then studied their physical application and meaning in different contexts ranging from superfluid vortices to the Haldane
                          model. Finally we introduced the mathematics that justify the study of artificial matter using Flouquet engineering.

                          introducing the micro-canonical, canonical and grand-canonical ensembles. The course finished on the thermodynamics
                          of fermions, low temperature free fermions, semi conductors, relativistic fermions and Bose Einstein statistics.

                          comfortable in applying the mathematical concepts that I saw in parralel in my math courses, such as: complex analysis
                          ( the residue theorem for example ), probability, analysis and many others.

                          understand the quantum mechanics course. It then ended on some perturbation methods such as multiple scales approximations or
                          the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation.

                          vorticity, instabilities and finally finished on turbulent flows.

                          the Lorentz group and then applied the concepts to electromagnetism in order to derive the covariant formulation of electromagnetism.
                          We then saw multiple useful tools and base cases such as multipolar expansion and light scattering. Finally we finished on an introduction
                          to relativistic quantum mechanics. This course was evaluated on a 4 week research project during which I studied together with Alessandro Pacco
                          the propagation of light in chiral dielectric media.

                          Bloch's theorem, Fermi levels and energy bands. The course then finished by studying semi-conductors and super-conductivity.

                      of all Lie Algebras in terms of their Dynkin diagrams. In doing so we studied weight spaces, the weight lattice with a special focus
                      on representations that arise in physics such as the spinor representation of so(2n+1, C).

                        We then moved on to random walks, the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and finished with percolation.

                        This is a Bachelor 3 course of the ENS math department taught by Pr. Patrick Bertrand that I am currently following.
                        The course provides a rigourous introduction to measure theory and the construction of all the framework behind modern
                        probability theory. The course will finish on the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

                        This is a Bachelor 2 course of the Ecole Polytechnique taught by Pr. Thomas Gauthier.
                        This course was the follow up of the Euclidean and Hermitian spaces course and it covered objects in bilinear 
                        algebra and their fundamental applications (e.g. in Number Theory and Mechanics), and also lead to the 
                        study of algebraic objects; for instance, some special groups of matrices, whose applications in mathematics 
                        and physics are fundamental, from Number Theory and geometry to the classification of particles.

                        This is a Bachelor 2 course of the Ecole Polytechnique.
                        This course builds upon the topology notions studied in Topology and multivariable calculus to allow 
                        for a more profound study of functions. Examining functions as limits of simpler ones (e.g. for 
                        approximation problems) is made possible in a rigorous manner thanks to topological ideas. 
                        This provides the possibility of using crucial tools in many scientific fields; the most striking one
                         being Fourier series. The second part of the course dealt with a wide array of differential equations.
