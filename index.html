                    Welcome to my webpage! If you don't want to look around here is a direct link to my <a href="CV.pdf">CV</a>. 
                    If, however, you want more details you can either ask me <a href="contact.html">here</a> or look around the page! 
                    I have a list of my Bachelor 2/3 and Master 1 courses over <a href = "courses.html">here</a>, a list of the
                    internships that I have done <a href="projects.html">here</a> and a list of distinctions that I have received
                    <a href="awards.html">here</a>. If you want you can also check my GitHub over

                    Short summary of studies and interest.
                </h2>
                <p class = "summary">
                    I am currently a Master 1 student in the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS), rue d'Ulm, International Centre 
                    for Fundamental Physics (IFCP) Master program. You can find a detail of the program 
                    <a href="https://www.phys.ens.fr/spip.php?rubrique284&lang=en">here</a>.
                     I did my Bachelor at Ecole Polytechnique from 2017/2018 to 2020 where I studied the fundamentals of Physics, Mathematics 
                     and Computer Science. I am still discovering a lot of new aspects in physics but for the moment the subjects 
                     that interest me most are the ones which relate to: out of equilibrium physics, random graph theory and 
                     general relativity. More generally the 'techniques'/'tools' that I enjoy using the most are: statistical physics,
                     probability, differential geometry and numerical methods. <br>
                     While it is true that I have spent most of my life in France I have always been part of a multi-cultural and 
                     international environment. I was in an international highschool, the Bachelor at Ecole Polytechnique
                     is an English international program and so is the ICFP Master I am currently enrolled in. I am fluent in English,
                     French and Italian and I speak some Spanish. <br>
                     As for non-physics related interests, I love fencing, skiing, sailing and chess and I am currently testing my neighbours
                     resilience by learning how to play violin.
