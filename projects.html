                <h2>2020 Summer Internship with Werner Krauth at ENS on Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms</h2>
                <p>
                    Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are current state of the art algorithms used to simulate complex many-bodies
                    interacting systems. In my internship I focused primarily on the extension of such algorithms so that they can 
                    be used on non-spherical particles so as to study phenomena such as phase transitions in liquid crystals. By the end
                    of the two month internship I managed to develop an algorithm that works with solid boundary conditions. We are 
                    currently developing the extension to periodic boundary conditions.

                    2019 Summer Internship with Laurent Sanchez Palencia at CPHT on Quantum localization transitions in quasi-periodic lattice systems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In collaboration with Alessandro Pacco we worked for two months on studying the fractal properties of quantum particles
                    in quasi-periodic potentials. We contributed to the numerical tools built by the Quantum Matter group and used them
                    to study the fractal dimensions at critical values of a quasi-periodic potential.

                    2018 Summer Internship with Adina Panchea on Robot Path/Motion Planning.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this two month internship I developped a new Path/Motion planning algorithm based on rapidly exploring random
                    trees. I also coded a graphical interface regrouping all most commonly known tree based path/motion planning algorithms.
